# Open WebUI Functions

These are functions I use for my own personal productivity and hope that others will find them useful too.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of utility functions and tools that I've developed (or am developing) to enhance my workflow with Open WebUI. They're designed to integrate with various AI models and services.

## Best Features

- Integration with Anthropic's Claude latest 3.7 models

## Installation of Functions

To add these functions to your Open WebUI instance:

1. Go to the Admin Panel in Open WebUI
2. Navigate to the "Functions" section
3. Click the "+" symbol in the top right corner
4. Upload or paste the function code
5. Save the function

## Usage

These functions are primarily for personal use, but feel free to adapt them for your own projects. The code is provided under the MIT license.

## Docker Logs

When running Open WebUI in a Docker container, please note that logs generated by these functions will only be visible:
- Through the `docker logs` command (e.g., `docker logs your-container-name`)
- Via the Docker Desktop application's logs viewer
- By accessing the container's filesystem directly

Logs will not be directly visible in the Open WebUI interface itself.

### Accessing Docker Logs

To view logs when Open WebUI is running in Docker:

1. **Using command line**:
   ```bash
   # View all logs
   docker logs your-container-name
   
   # View only the most recent logs
   docker logs --tail 100 your-container-name
   
   # Follow logs in real-time
   docker logs -f your-container-name
   ```

2. **Using Docker Desktop**:
   - Open Docker Desktop
   - Go to the "Containers" tab
   - Find your Open WebUI container
   - Click on the container name
   - Select the "Logs" tab

3. **Log levels**:
   The code uses different log levels (debug, info, warning, error) to categorize messages. You can filter logs by severity if needed.
